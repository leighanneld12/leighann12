  <h6> Unit 7 </h6>
  <p> What I have learned about in Unit 7 is that I am able to tell the difference
  between content management systems, blogging software, wikis, and website publishing tools.
  I have also learned that CMS stands for content management system and it involves uploading content. 
  For examples, are text, images, audio, and video. There are probably more that users can upload aswell.
  CMS also supports  multiple users working collaboratively. I have learned that the 3 most popular CMS's are Drupal,
  Joomla, and WordPress. Another thing I have learned is 'blogging software' and it is a CMS software that was specifically 
  designed to support blogs.(It is also short for 'Web log') Visitors able to add comments to the individual entries or posts
  that are uploaded. One of the blogging software that is quiete popular is the 'CMS WordPress' and it still serves a function today.
  WordPress is also free and a downloadable, open source.
