<head><h1> Usability Study</h1></head>
<p> What I have learned in in the Usability Test is that if you run
a website through the validator, it will find the mistakes or "errors"
that the website may contain. I putted the borentown website through it 
and barley any errors were found but mostly warning signs. The target audience 
mostly consist of older adults like staff and teachers. It also may consist of 
students and other programs that may be involved in the school setting system.
It took a little while for us to find what we had to do with the website but 
we got it down after 45 mins. The 3 tasks that were assigned to us were three
different websites that we had to put through the validator and see if there
were any errors within the 3 websites. We were able to complete I think 2
of the tasks. We had trouble on the first one due to a misunderstanding in
the directions that were assigned. It took a little over maybe 30-45 mins to
complete, It took like 4 steps to complete the last tasks. What I learned about
overall of the website was that it very complicated to find information regaurding
the site. I also thought the colors were bland and very boring. Overall an ugly site. 
I think the site should be designed differently by brighter colors and make it easier 
to find information.
